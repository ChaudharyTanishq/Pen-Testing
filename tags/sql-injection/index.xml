      <description>Hacker101 CTF: Micro-CMS v1 Writeup 1. Exploration Landing page shows two files. Looks like we are going to deal with markdown. Creating new page allows us to put in title and some content. Fact: markdown supports html. This means we can try all sorts of XSS attacks. Script tag doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.

      <description>Play
This room has a solid start:
To whom it may concern, I know it was you who hacked my blog. I was really impressed with your skills. You were a little sloppy and left a bit of a footprint so I was able to track you down. But, thank you for taking me up on my offer. I&#39;ve done some initial enumeration of the site because I know *some* things about hacking but not enough.</description>
